Analyze configuration tests in the deprecations category previously sent the
full error message and traceback directly to the corresponding users when
internal errors occurred.

Now, if there is an error, the deprecation message is no longer triggered.
Instead, the analyze configuration page displays a hint below the failed test
section. Moreover, the full error or traceback can be viewed in the web.log
file.

This change prevents users from seeing confusing error tracebacks directly on
the page, reducing clutter and making it easier to focus on the test results.
If detailed error information is needed for troubleshooting, it is available in
the web.log file.
