The cisco_secure check plugin incorrectly reported CRITICAL "Port Security" violations on Cisco Firepower FX-OS appliances for virtual interfaces called Vethernet, even when no actual security violations occurred.
It triggered a CRITICAL status whenever the port security status was "shutdown" (value 3), regardless of whether the violation_count was 0 and no violating MAC address was recorded.

This fix ensures that the check only reports CRITICAL alerts when there is clear evidence of a security violation—specifically, when the violation_count is greater than 0 or a violating MAC address is detected.

As a result, users will experience fewer false CRITICAL alerts on Cisco Firepower virtual interfaces, improving alert accuracy and reducing unnecessary investigations.
To apply this fix, users should update the cisco_secure check plugin to the latest version; no additional configuration changes or restarts are required.
