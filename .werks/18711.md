The dashboard management experience is now fully integrated and streamlined, enabling a more coherent experience across various workflows. The dashboard creation process has been simplified, with advanced options and filters moved into dedicated dashboard and filter settings.

* **Unified Live Context:** Creation and configuration pages are integrated into a live-updated context. It is no longer necessary to leave the dashboard view to configure its settings.  
* **Cloning details:** When cloning a dashboard, it is now possible to edit the name of the new dashboard directly during the process.  
* **Explicit Saving & Reverting:** The system no longer persists every change (such as widget placement) automatically. Changes must now be explicitly saved via the **Save** button. This allows for the cancellation of an edit session to discard all layout and configuration changes, quickly reverting to the previous state.
