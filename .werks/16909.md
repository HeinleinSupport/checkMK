`Failed notifications` and `Total sent notifications` had been treated differently
regarding the time window used to limit the number of notifications displayed:
`Failed notifications` would be limited by the "Failed notification horizon"
global setting as well as by the last acknowledgement, while `Total sent notifications`
would be limited by a hardcoded 7 day horizon.
That makes it impossible to handle excessive amounts of notifications by reducing
the applied horizon also for `Total sent notifications`.

This change renames the internally used name `failed_notification_horizon` to
`notification_horizon` in global settings (which is why this werk is marked as
non-compatible) and now applies it to both `Failed notifications` and `Total sent notifications`.

Migration from old to new name is done automatically, however if the specific
name `failed_notification_horizon` had been used in any custom scripts, it now
has to be adapted to `notification_horizon`.
