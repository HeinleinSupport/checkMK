For Dell devices, the ServiceTag represents the serial number, just as it does for other hardware devices.

The ServiceTag is now also added for Dell devices in the hardware/software inventory. This enhancement allows users to view the serial number directly within the inventory, improving asset tracking and identification. No action is required; the ServiceTag will appear automatically after the next inventory update.
