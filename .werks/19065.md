If a user didn't select any hosts, bulk discovery would run into an exception with the error message "Number of processes must be at least 1".

With this change, there will be no bulk discovery attempted for an empty selection.
Instead, the user will get the following message: "The selected options do not match any hosts, nothing to do."
