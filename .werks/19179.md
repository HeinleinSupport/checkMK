The aws_ec2_limits plugin now generates graphs for the following EC2 instance types: r6a, r6i, r6id, r8g, and r8gd. This addition extends the AWS plugin family by providing detailed monitoring metrics for these specific instance types.

These new graphs help you better understand resource usage and limits for the supported EC2 instances. No action is required; the graphs will appear automatically when these instances are detected.
