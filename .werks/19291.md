Previously, the NetApp ONTAP special agent always fetched node information from
the API, regardless of which resources were configured to be monitored. This
caused unnecessary API calls when only resources that don't require node
information were selected.

Now, the special agent only fetches node information when it's actually needed,
specifically when monitoring nodes, fans, or temperature sensors. This reduces
API overhead and improves performance when monitoring a subset of NetApp
resources.
