The cisco_wlc_9800_clients plugin now detects the Cisco C9800-L-C-K9 (sysObjectID .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.1.2860).

Users with Cisco C9800-L-C-K9 devices benefit from automatic monitoring by this plugin, providing improved visibility into these devices without requiring any manual configuration.

Thanks to GitHub user meni2029 for contributing this enhancement.
