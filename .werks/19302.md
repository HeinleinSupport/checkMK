As of Kubernetes 1.33 (with the `DeploymentReplicaSetTerminatingReplicas` feature
gate enabled), Kubernetes reports the number of terminating replicas within
Deployment ReplicaSets.

Checkmk now tracks this metric, enabling you to configure alerts if a
replica remains in Terminating state for too long.

Users can configure levels in the "Kubernetes replicas" ruleset.
