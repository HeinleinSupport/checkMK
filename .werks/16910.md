HP MSA session logout failed silently when calling the `/logout/` endpoint together with the session key. Attempts to log out appeared to complete without error, but sessions remained open. The audit log showed messages such as:

```
... A[logout -] SSID:0 RC:5 M:[Invalid Session] ...
```

This behavior could lead to resource management issues by leaving sessions active unintentionally.

Note: this attempt was taken from a misleading support forum entry, since the logout feature itself is not documented.

This change now calls the `/logout/` endpoint without the session key, which successfully closes sessions on 2060/2062/1060 controller appliances. Users do not need to modify their workflow but will benefit from reliable session termination and improved session management.
