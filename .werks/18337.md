The adapter RAM in the `Hardware > Graphic cards: Memory` column previously
displayed a value of zero when the agent plugin `mk_inventory` provided no value.

Now, this field is left empty in such cases, more accurately reflecting the
absence of information.

Please note that this change also generates a HW/SW Inventory history entry.
