*The issue:*

Previously, monitored Linux hosts with installed Checkmk server package, but without Checkmk site, were incorrectly labelled with `cmk/check_mk_server:yes`.

*Details:*

If the `omd` command is available on a monitored Linux host, the Linux agent reports agent sections about available Checkmk installations and sites.
This is the case as soon as any Checkmk version is installed on the host.
On the server side, the host then got automatically labelled with `cmk/check_mk_server:yes`

However, as long as no Checkmk site is created on the host, there is no Checkmk server.
Hence, we now only label the host as Checkmk server if one or more Checkmk sites are created on the monitored system.
