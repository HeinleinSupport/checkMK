RRD file names longer than 255 characters exceed the limits of common filesystems such as ext3 and ext4. This limitation caused certain metrics to generate file names that were too long to be supported.

As a result, log files were flooded with errors, and in some cases, this even led to partial system freezes.

Starting with this release, we automatically skip metrics that would require excessively long file names. Such skips are reported in cmc.log (Example: WARNING: Can't create rrd file for your-host very-long-service-name-which-doesnt-fit because path is too long or invalid.), so users might notice missing data for them.

No user action is required to handle this change.
