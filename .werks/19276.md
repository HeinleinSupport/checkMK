The agent updater status part within the _Check_MK Agent_ service now receives its data
through a dedicated agent plugin instead of relying on cached information.

Previously, the agent updater status was based on cached data that was only updated once
per update cycle. The agent updater tried to update the cache file directly to overcome
this limitation, but this was fragile and didn't work in every situation.

The new approach deploys a synchronous agent plugin (on both Linux and Windows) that runs
the agent updater in a dedicated status mode on every check cycle. This means the agent
updater status section always reflects current data.

Additionally, error handling has been improved: the `last_error` field is now properly
reset after a successful agent updater run, so you won't see outdated error messages.
