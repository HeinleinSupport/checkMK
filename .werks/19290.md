Previously, the _Storage flow_ and _Storage performance_ services
for Azure storage accounts would go to UNKN state when the storage account
was idle with no traffic.

This occurred because Azure calculates availability and performance metrics
based on actual traffic rather than a continuous "heartbeat" check. Consequently,
when a storage account is idle, the Azure API returns empty values
because there were no transactions to measure during that time window.

The checks now handle this correctly:
- Services are discovered for all storage accounts, regardless of current activity
- When data is available, metrics are displayed normally
- When no data is available (storage account is idle), the service reports OK with the message "No data in the Azure API response due to inactivity on the storage account."

This means seeing data only at specific intervals simply indicates that
at least one request occurred during that window, while the "missing" hours
represent periods of inactivity, which is a normal state, not an error.

After upgrading, users may want to re-discover to actually start monitoring these storage
account services.
Services that were previously oscillating between UNKN and OK states will
now remain in OK state during idle periods.
