The Kubernetes check plugin `kube_pod_conditions` now supports two additional
PodConditions:

- `PodResizePending`
- `PodResizeInProgress`

Information about these conditions can be found in the upstream Kubernetes
[documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/resize-container-resources/#pod-resize-status).

Levels for these can be set in the ruleset "Kubernetes pod conditions".

In contrast to the monitored PodConditions up until now, alerting will happen
when these new conditions are _true_ for too long, rather than when they are
_false_ for too long.

This allows you to be notified when a resize has been ongoing for an extended
period of time, or when it cannot be carried out for some reason.
