The `netscaler_cpu` check plugin now respects the `Average` configuration provided by the `CPU utilization of simple devices` ruleset.

Previously, it reported inaccurate CPU metrics and triggered incorrect alerts. No changes to your existing rules or configurations are required to benefit from this fix.
