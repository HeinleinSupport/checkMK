Checkmk scans all files before adding them to the Support Diagnostics dump. 
It redacts all passwords, secrets, tokens, keys, and similar sensitive data from the .mk files added.
The Diagnostics UI page now reflects updated High/Medium/Insensitive categorization.

Please note the following limitations:

- Verify manually that third-party or custom extensions integrated with the UI have their configuration data properly redacted.
- Log files are also scanned but not fully covered by redaction. If you use higher log levels, manually verify these logs for sensitive data.
- Files in $OMD_ROOT/var/check_mk/core are also not covered by redaction. Manually verify these files as well.
