In version 2.3.0, the special agent configuration allowed users to pass macros
to the "Server Name" field, enabling dynamic server naming.

However, a regression introduced in version 2.4.0 removed support for macros in
this field, preventing users from using this functionality.

This fix restores macro support in the "Server Name" field, allowing users who
previously relied on macros to use them again without needing to update their
existing configurations.
