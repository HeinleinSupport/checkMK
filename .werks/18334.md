The command `OMD[<SITE>]:~$ cmk -vi[i] <HOST>` shows a preview of the inventory
run but does not save any trees.

In order to compute changes the previous tree must be taken into account: If
there is an inventory tree then use this one. If there is no inventory tree but
an inventory archive then use the latest tree from the archive.

Until now the tree from the archive was not taken into account. This has been
fixed now.
