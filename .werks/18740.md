The infoblox_systeminfo inventory plugin previously failed to detect some Infoblox devices because it only checked whether the sysDescr contained the string "infoblox." Certain Infoblox models do not include "infoblox" in their sysDescr, which caused these devices to be excluded from hardware and software inventory scans.

We fixed this by using the shared DETECT_INFOBLOX detection, which identifies Infoblox devices if either the sysDescr contains "infoblox" or the sysObjectID starts with .1.3.6.1.4.1.7779.1 (the Infoblox enterprise OID).

This change aligns the inventory plugin’s detection method with other Infoblox check plugins, such as infoblox_services, ensuring that all Infoblox devices are now properly included in inventory scans.
As a result, no user action is required, and any previously missing Infoblox devices will now appear correctly in your hardware and software inventory.
