Certificate monitoring now correctly displays the Subject CN (common name) of
certificates when it is present.

Previously, the Subject CN field could appear empty even though the certificate
contained this information, which might have caused confusion or difficulty in
identifying certificates.

With this fix, the Subject CN reliably appears in the monitoring interface,
improving clarity and usability.

No user action is required to benefit from this update.
