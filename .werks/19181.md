The metric name previously appeared inconsistently as "commit charge" in some
places and "virtual memory" in others, causing confusion among users.

To address this, we now use the term "virtual memory" consistently across the
man page, graphs, and services. Users will see this unified terminology in all
relevant locations, which helps reduce confusion when interpreting memory
metrics. No action is required from users to adapt to this change.
