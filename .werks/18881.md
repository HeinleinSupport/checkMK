The filesystem/df plugins now only show a trend after one full period of data
has been collected (a period is defined by the setting "Time range for trend
computation" in the "File systems (used space and growth)" rule set).

After this change, the plugins will initially only report instantaneous data and
no trend prediction, and the summary of the plugins will reflect this.

After one full period has passed, the trend will show in the summary as before.

No action is required by users.
