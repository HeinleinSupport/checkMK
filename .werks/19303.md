The check "Check_MK Agent" now allows for customizing the thresholds for the
maximum time elapsed since the last update check was performed. This was
previously internally set to warn after 2 days and was not able to be
customized.

As a result of this change, by default the check will continue to warn after 2
days, as before, but will now additionally go to critical state after 30 days.

This can now be customized via the rule set "Checkmk agent installation
auditing".
