Werk #15084 introduced support for the `maxUnavailable` field for
`StatefulSet`s with `RollingUpdate`.

The value is displayed in the inventory tree for `StatefulSet`s.

A crash was later discovered which occurred when the field returned an integer
rather than a string.

This resulted in a crash of the Kubernetes special agent with a
`ValidationError`.

This bug is now fixed.

Notably, Kubernetes v1.35 enables the feature gate `MaxUnavailableStatefulSet`
by default (graduated to Beta), causing this bug to be seen more commonly.

No interaction is required from users to make use of this fix.
