description:
 This check reports metrics regarding performance of monitored
 azure storage accounts.
 You can configure levels for server latency, end-to-end latency
 and availability.
 In order to use this check, you need to configure the Azure special agent.

 Azure calculates availability based on actual traffic rather than a
 continuous "heartbeat" check. Consequently, when your storage account
 is idle, the API returns empty values because there were no transactions
 to measure. When no data is available, the service will go OK and show
 the message "No data in the Azure API response due to inactivity on the
 storage account."

item:
 The name of the resource.

discovery:
 One service is created for each storage account.
