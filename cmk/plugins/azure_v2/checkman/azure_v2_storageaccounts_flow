description:
 This check reports metrics regarding data flow of monitored
 azure storage accounts.
 You can configure levels for ingress, egress and transaction
 count.
 In order to use this check, you need to configure the Azure special agent.
 Since Azure calculates availability based on actual traffic rather than
 a continuous heartbeat check, when the storage account is idle, the API
 returns empty values because there were no transactions to measure.
 In such cases, the service will report OK with "No data in the Azure API
 response due to inactivity on the storage account."

item:
 The name of the resource.

discovery:
 One service is created for each storage account.
