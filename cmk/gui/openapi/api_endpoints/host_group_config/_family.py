    description="""Host groups are a way to organize hosts in Checkmk for monitoring.
By using a host group you can generate suitable views for overview and/or analysis.

The hosts part of a host group can be queried using the Monitoring's relevant host_status endpoints.

You can find an introduction to hosts including host groups in the
[Checkmk guide](https://docs.checkmk.com/latest/en/wato_hosts.html).

A host group object can have the following relations present in `links`:

 * `self` - The host group itself.
 * `urn:org.restfulobject/rels:update` - An endpoint to change this host group.
 * `urn:org.restfulobject/rels:delete` - An endpoint to delete this host group.
