description: Interacts with Gerrit code review to list changes and improve them

# When asked to submit a Gerrit change:

```
curl -s --netrc "https://review.lan.tribe29.com/a/changes/125896/submit" -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'
```

This will submit the change and all its unmerged parents
(provided all the changes have the required approvals).

# When asked to improve a Gerrit change:

1. Fetch the current state from Gerrit

`gerrit-change-log HEAD`

2. In case a Verified -1 is reported, fetch the Jenkins job results using the jenkins skill
3. For each failed stage, fetch the details of the triggered stage job

# When asked for the list of open Gerrit changes

```
# List all your open changes
gerrit-change-log --list

# Find changes needing attention (negative score)
gerrit-change-log --list | grep ':-'
```

# In case the command gerrit-change-log is missing

Ask the user to clone the zeug_cmk git repository and add it to their PATH.
