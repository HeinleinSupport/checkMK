title: Kubernetes: Pod Conditions
agents: kubernetes
catalog: containerization/kubernetes

distribution: check_mk
description:
 A Pod's status depends on an array of PodConditions through which the
 Pod has or has not yet passed. This check monitors the status of each
 condition (scheduled, initialized, containersready and ready, along with
 resizepending and resizeinprogress as of Kubernetes v1.33) and the
 duration of the condition if it is in an abnormal state. This check does not
 monitor custom conditions.

 Upper levels for WARN/CRIT can be defined to determine how much time must pass
 before an alert is triggered when a condition is in an abnormal state for an
 extended period of time.

discovery:
 One service is created representing pod conditions.
