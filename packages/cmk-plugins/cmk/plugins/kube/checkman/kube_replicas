description:
 This check monitors the number of Kubernetes replicas.

 In the event that the number of ready or up-to-date replicas is below the
 number of desired replicas, the check by default shows a WARN and CRIT state
 if this persists for more than 5 minutes and 10 minutes respectively.

 Additionally, the following are monitored and subject to the same defaults
 described above:

 - Misscheduled Pods controlled by a DaemonSet
 - Terminating Pods controlled by a Deployment

 The check also monitors the number of replicas that are available. However, this
 is only done if the MinReadySeconds field is non-zero. For MinReadySeconds = 0,
 the available replicas are omitted as they are always equal to the ready replicas.

 It is possible to configure the grace period for each state using the
 "Kubernetes: Replicas" ruleset.

 Please note that replicas may temporarily be in a not ready, out-of-date or
 misscheduled state during the process of an update. It is therefore advised to
 always have a grace period configured.

discovery:
 One service is created for each Kubernetes object which supports replicas.
